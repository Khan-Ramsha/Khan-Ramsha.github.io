Greetings, Earthlings! You just landed on the space of a curious mind - a serendipitous computer engineering student whose journey into tech began with a spark and kept gaining momentum with every discovery.

What began as a casual exploration with "let's see where it goes" turned into an adventure through interconnected worlds - hopping from data analytics to machine learning, to deep learning and now **reinforcement learning** like stepping stones - each step pulling me deeper into the world of math, algorithms and occasionally late-night debugging crisis (spoiler: it stops being a crisis the moment the bug finally surrenders).

Somewhere along the way, I realised curiosity was my real co-pilot. It's what keep me learning, tinkering with models, developing stuffs solving real-world problem and nudging me closer to my promising destination: becoming a researcher.

When I'm not wrangling with tensors, you might find me reading research papers, studying optimization algorithm (yes, it genuinely excites me - currently diving deep into policy optimization algorithms).

I'm excited to build **safe** and **explainable** intelligent systems that genuinely understand and navigate the messy, marvelous complexity of our world. (plot twist: some of the messiest problems teach you the most)
