Greetings, Earthlings! You just landed on the space of a curious mind - a serendipitous computer engineering student whose journey into tech began with a spark and kept gaining momentum with every discovery.

What began as a casual exploration with "let's see where it goes" turned into an adventure through interconnected worlds, hopping from data analytics to **machine learning**, to **deep learning**, and now **reinforcement learning** like stepping stones, each step pulling me deeper into the world of math, algorithms, and occasionally late-night debugging crises (spoiler: it stops being a crisis the moment the bug finally surrenders).

Somewhere along the way, I realised curiosity was my real co-pilot. It's what keeps me learning, tinkering with models and developing practical solutions to real-world problems. I also got my hands dirty as a **Data Analyst Intern**, where I transformed complex datasets into storytelling goldmines - turning messiest data into actionable insights, uncovering hidden patterns and crafting visualizations that made complex data whisper its secrets to business stakeholders.

When I'm not wrangling with tensors, you might find me reading research papers, studying optimization algorithms (yes, it genuinely excites me - currently diving deep into **policy optimization algorithms**).

I'm excited to build **safe** and **explainable** intelligent systems that genuinely understand and navigate the messy, marvelous complexity of our world. (plot twist: some of the messiest problems teach you the most)
